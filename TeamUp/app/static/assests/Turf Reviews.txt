1)  Turf Air Plaza:
Address: Located in New Town, Action Area 3, near SNU

Reviews:
1) Well mentained porche society üèôÔ∏èüèòÔ∏è with decorated parküèïÔ∏è‚õ≤. Connectivity to city through public transport is quite lowüöÜüöç. Car owners will not face any problem. Locality is pleasing considering the noise of the cityüåù. All modern facility is available including departmental store, security check.

2) First of all this is an overhyped place , transportation facilities are very less (only a few buses available , best option is to go on your personal vehicle , the quality of the turf is quite good , the ambience is also great , but the turf needs improvement . Well it is a 6-a side ground , flood lights are there (5 PM onwards) , drinking water is available free of cost , lots of food options are also available such as KFC , Pizza Hut , Sub Way , Reliance Fresh , etc.

3) A huge community with the right security and facilities. As December, its below 15 Celsius and with the flora surrounding, its extremely cold and pleasant

4) Nice little plaza here. It has a grocery and a food court

5) Well maintained , one of the best place to hang out with your friends while playing the beautiful game ‚ù§Ô∏è. We need more turfs like this in other districts as well.

6) It is one of the best places to hang out with friends for playing football. This turf is maintained very well.

7) Its a football court on above reliance freah mart. Its a good community area and where you will also find Dominos,Subway,multiple coffee cafes and a bar cum restraunt as well

8) Complex looks good from outside. Construction of individual flat is not up to the mark.. More over AOA management is arrogant and corrupt to core. They made the complex most horrible, collect huge fees per month as so called 'maintenance fees' to fight legal battle against those who challenged their misdeeds. You can consider this complex like a b-grade hotel where you need to pay for every silly things and you need to take management permission for every little things. If you stay there or shift out there, beware of management and dogs.

9) The turf is in great shape and is well maintained. Played for 2hours for 3000rs. The time management is also well maintained and the gaurd was friendly. The only thing you have to make sure is that you gotta carry your own ball as the footballs there is not in a good shape.
Also it's on the first floor, opposite UEM.

10) Huge complex with massive flats...well maintained...while the builder finish in some areas is not up to the mark overall a nice place to live in...New town anyways seems to be on the upswing being part of Smart city syndrome and seems to be headed in the right direction...New Town appears to be the place for Kolkata's future well planned with good connectivity..

2)  Skyturf:
Address: Situated at 209, AJC Bose Road, near Circus Avenue

Reviews:
1) The turf itself is great but the approach isn‚Äôt. Also it‚Äôs difficult to find parking around the building unless you‚Äôre lucky to find a spot in the lane behind.
The turf is one of the best-maintained in the city and yes, their prices are steeper than the others but I think they cater more to the corporate clientele

2) Horrible experience at Sky Turf Kolkata! A friend tried to book the venue and was made to wait for two long weeks, only to be turned down without any real explanation. The owner, Saket, clearly prioritizes looking busy over providing basic courtesy, and the manager was uncommunicative throughout the process. Highly unprofessional and frustrating‚Äîdefinitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone.

3) One of my favourite turfs in the city! The people are great and the encourage you to play sports. The facilities are great as well. You can definitely play to your heart‚Äôs content here!

4) Absolutely pathetic service at Sky Turf Kolkata. We were kept on hold for two whole weeks, constantly chasing for updates and confirmations, only to be refused at the last minute‚Äîwithout even a direct conversation! The owner, Saket, seems to be more interested in making himself look busy rather than addressing customer concerns. The manager‚Äôs communication is equally disappointing‚Äîvague, unresponsive, and entirely unhelpful. If you value your time and want to avoid unnecessary frustration, stay far away from this place. An incredibly poor experience that I would not recommend to anyone.

5) I recently had a terrible experience with Sky Turf Kolkata. A friend had been coordinating with them for over two weeks, hoping to finalize a booking, but the entire process was a disaster. Despite multiple follow-ups, they were eventually refused without any direct communication. The owner, Saket, portrays himself as far too busy to handle customer concerns, and the manager‚Äôs lack of communication skills only made things worse. The whole experience was frustrating and unprofessional‚Äîdefinitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone looking for reliable service.

6) Extremely poor experience with Sky Turf Kolkata! They kept my friend on hold for weeks, making countless promises, only to cancel without even a proper conversation. The owner, Saket, acts far too important to bother with basic customer service, and the manager is equally unresponsive. It was a complete waste of time and energy. If you‚Äôre looking for reliable service, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

7) 1 star less for the rates.. it's a bit expensive. Charged us 2400 per hour for the football ground .. rest, the place is awesome.. they have cricket pitch as well.

8) Though the view is good and the location is best but the prices are very high as compared to other turf which are having many facilities its size is also a bit smaller and they should look after this matters for betterment...........

9) Great experience. Good artificial ground on the roof top for playing cricket and football. There is a small cafe also, but very costly.

10) Good place for playing football. Spacious. Staff behaviour is also good. But the tarrif is too high. Very expensive according to me.

3)  Elgin Turf:
Address: Located on Justice Dwarkanath Road, near Lala Lajpat Rai Sarani

Reviews:
1) Good for 7 side cricket or football. But, only players can be accommodated, problems for supporters and viewers because of place shortage. So, problem to organize any corporate sports event here. 

2) We have most of our matches here every alternate Saturday its a good place but not suitable during summers as its not open roof but effective during rains due to same reason

3) Is a great place ngl
Good for 5 a side team (football)
They even have a small pantry for soft drinks and snacks
Prices are reasonable too
but it lacks ventilation, maybe they need to install fans over the nets because even durring the evening time, it was very hot
Spikes not allowed, which is a turnoff but still not a big problem
They provide us with Football/criket bats, wickets and balls but it's advisable to bring your own football...

4) It's 5mins from Rabindra Sadan metro gate 3. Good place for cricket practice, fees is moderate, 1500rs per hour. They provide all the sports equipments. Lights provided so we can play after afternoon as well.

5) Turf - when kids wants to play during rain and they enjoy playing is elgin turf. Fully indoor

6) Very bad experience.
I suggest you to avoid this turf.
Extremely unprofessional.
The turf is hard and it seems like a carpet.
I wish there was negative rating.

7) Good playground but not on any rooftop.. Enough space for audience at one end.

8) Great Place to Play.Nice and comfertable ambience clean environment.Keep up the Good Work

9) I went to Elgin Turf in my birthday with my friends and I had a very enjoyable experience which will be cherished over the years by us.
The place was very neatly and tidy with no debris lying about here and there. It is around 40m long and 15m wide so it's possible for a 4v4 football match. The ground is fake grass..
The people were hospitable and have us our slot on time. I would recommend you going there with your friends or family ..

10) Super big area to play football and cricket with Coach provided at a charge. 2500 per hour is little steep.
Would love if the sides were also dry not wet due to rains. The ground shud have been of wood. My son's 11 th Birthday party was memorable. Thanx !

4)  Blob Turf
Address: 8th Floor (Terrace, Yamuna Apartment, 86, Golaghata Rd, Dakshindari, South Dumdum, West Bengal 700048

Reviews:
1) Only one phrase can be uttered about this place: 'oh, lovely'. This place is located on the rooftop of Bengal Dhaba and GTPL building, proving football and cricket games facility for enthusiastic people. Of course the play ground is quite small, much smaller than the actual grounds, but after the entire day of work pressure, people can definitely relax here with football or cricket games.
All you have to do is, book the place @rs. 2500 per hour, call some of your colleagues after the normal office time and...boom! Enjoy the game and the open rooftop ambience.

2) A great place to play football, price is also ok for 1 hour and we can get a great view of the fly over, the only thing I don't like is the cricket pitch in the middle which is very slippery ....

3) Lovely place. Very comfortable and convenient location. Very nice staff. Free cold water availabe. Sitting area and fans for people sitting. Locker facilities also there. Good and reasonable. Will visit again

4) Small turf but located at a very convenient location. Great view from the top, management is cooperative and helpful throughout. Has dedicated washroom for changing as well and also has all time working water filter at no extra cost!

5) Very good roof top turf for football as well as cricket. Field size is big enough for 4aside football as well as 5 aside if big adults are not playing.. water dispenser is available. Over all neat and clean and they are planning to expand with food and everything else. Its gonna be big.

6) My experience at BLOB was fantastic! The turf is very well structured and the management is quite welcoming and cooperative. Our group had a really good time and we look forward to playing here again. Way to go guys! You're doing a great job!

7) Place is good & clean. They have shower facility as well with good lighting. Eateries also available. Sanitizer also installed. Chairs are available for spectators. Could be little bigger but overall it's a fine playground. Rates are 2500 per hour. Overall it's good, no inconvenience.

8) Amazing place to chill around..Great food, cool vibe, fun activities and amazing view makes it a perfect place, more so for all age groups..they also have some amazing co-working space and a turf..highly recommended!!

9) The atmosphere is good, staffs behavior is good. But the turf quality is not good for playing football. Your feet will stuck in the turf whenever you want to shoot the ball.

10) No provisons for Medical emergencies and escorting the victim becomes even less favourable owing to the narrow lifts. No provisions for First Aid and the managers are quite rude too. You never know which of the players may get injured and then one is left helpless with the unattending staff and lack of efficient management. This review is based on a real incident, would request everyone to boycott.

5)  V/S sports Arena
Address: 2b, 1, Wood Burn Rd, Sreepally, Bhowanipore, Kolkata, West Bengal 700020

Reviews:
1) Good turf for football in South Kolkata
Location Calcutta Punjab Clob, near Minto Park
Very good experience - 4.4/5

2) This is our home turf we love playing here, it's pricing is also affordable and the pitch, post, ball provided everything is top notch üëç

3) Good behaviour and ground is well maintained with minimal amount for 1hour

4) Poor No Maintenance nothing Horrible Experience

5) Size is not very large, but it would be good for 7 a side play including goalkeeper..
I would say that the turf is rather on the longish side , so long balls would be a part of the playing style..
They provide with one or two footballs but those were not of good quality..
Recommended to take your own footballs.
It is available per hour basis
Rate 1875 for 1:30 hrs
1200 for 1 hr

6) These turf clubs have changed the sporting scene in Kolkata. Getting your friends together and having a great time has never been so easy.
Life is sports.
Cheers.

7) Best turf in this price range for maximum 6 a side matches.....Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è

8) Very nice place and lot of greenery with tree's all around, best place for playing football and futsal. A good amount of space is available in turf, almost 6 players can play.

9) I wish I could give 0 stars because they don't turn on the AC very poor servicing, turf ground is rough high risk of injury, and the man who manages the turf is very arrogant, when we ask him to turn on the AC he always ignores..

10) A great turf. The price is very reasonable as compared to other turfs in Kolkata. You can easily play a 7 a side match. They provide you with one football. It is better to take your own football for a perfect match.

The facilities are clean, well-organized, and water bottles are available on a paid basis for convenience.

A special mention to Jyotsna ‚Äì she‚Äôs been incredibly cordial and helpful throughout. Being a sportsperson herself, she brings a level of professionalism and passion that really shows in the way the arena is run.

The food, beverages, and overall atmosphere made for a fantastic evening out with family and friends. Highly recommend AV Sports Arena for sports
enthusiasts üòä

10) Bad facilities, giving no extra time even of 5 minutes and caretaker full of attitude. Even no first aid present. Not at all recommend at 1200 per hour

7)  Cloud Turf and Cafe
Address: 17th Floor, Sls Tower, GP Block, Sector V, Bidhannagar, Kolkata, West Bengal 700091

Reviews:
1) It's a very beautiful and well maintained turf in sector 5 area. Enough space for playing cricket. Amazing ambience with a nice cafe. The staffs are well behaved and the owner is very helpful. You can undoubtedly try it.

2) It was a nice experience playing here- turf is nice and well maintained...Location can be an issue for some...Also owner please take note- we booked from 9:30 to 11:30 PM and exactly when the time was over, your men started switching off the lights..I mean let us complete our game and if you want you take some extra money for the extra 10-15 minutes time we played even that's acceptable....But starting to switch off the lights by saying Time is over is extra professional behavior- please correct this!

3) very bad experience, changing room is very dirty, changing clothes is not possible.
Only one changing room with lot of dust and wet floor, seems like station side pay & use toilet.
No proper sitting arrangement. just some pandle chairs.
Ground is clean and well for playing.

In short overall experience is much below than average.

4) Excellent management, very good food,my team played 6match,but I got batting in only one match, inspite of repeated practice.so not interested to join again.

5) The turf is genuinely located at a good place! The views are very good and a lot of people visit the arena. Didn‚Äôt visit the cafe but I think the cafe is also good. If you want to play and have fun, the turf is great!

6) Good place and reasonable rates to play your favourite game. It also has a kitchen counter to grab a quick snack and they also provide sports equipment if anyone is unable to bring one. It‚Äôs open till late nights. Highly recommended‚Ä¶

7) Very nice place for Birthday party and the arrangement was upto mark and Food was also very tasty. The service and staff behaviour was also very good.

8) Wonderful owner, well maintained turf, good for 4-5 sided football matches. The high altitude is a boon during the summer and keeps you away from the pollution!

10) Well maintained cricket turf with good facilities, Organised some lovely Cricket tournaments.

9)  Super Sports Park
Address: Ecospace, Mohammad pur dhali para kamar bari men rot, Newtown, Kolkata, West Bengal 700135

Reviews:
1) One of the best and cheapest turf in Kolkata.
If you book this ground for playing football you can play 6 v 6.
Everything is good and fine. The synthetic grass quality is also very good. One of the drawback of this turf is the location. That's why its not too much popular. Good rooftop ground go and play with your friends.

Parking not available.
Changing room and washroom available.
Water bottle 20rs/lit.

2) Turf quality is average but according to the price one of the best sports fields in Kolkata. ‚öΩü•Ö

3) Please do not come to this turf.
Staff behavior is too rude.
Confirmation was done with one price and asked for higher price at time of payment. They even charge money for water.
And come to give slangs. No Recommend at all.

4) A good turf with greater width and length than some fo the others in Kolkata.

5) Length wise it's good. But the quality not so. The ground is very hard and not many layers beneath your feet. Feels like playing on concrete. Not good for knees and ankle joints.

6) The turf is very good in such a price and nowhere else can you find such good staff and service, you could have done a little more but there is no problem, I would say that one time must go to the turf.

7) The turf that they offer is not the standard for playing football. For and ideal turf there should be multiple layers of rubber/ sand etc beneath the surface to make it feel soft, but that is not the case for this turf. It feels too hard and will tire your legs

8) No fans to rest after game. But maybe one of the cheapest turfs in Kolkata and quality wise good too!

9) Terrible experience, got a call just half an hour before booking that he will have to cancel as he has to leave the premise. Not reliable at all and many last minute change they ask you to do. Would not recommend to anyone.

10) Very bad and poor quality turf. Water pump flow is very very very bad and pathetic. After rain it turns into a small pond. I advise everyone please don't go, you are wasting your time.

2) Very short area. Preferably for 5 side games. Proper arrangements for the washroom and drinking water. The building does not have dedicated space for parking. Fee parking is available outside the building.
View from turf is very nice

3) Lovely experience at a reasonable price! Located at the 16th floor of Srijan Techpark, it is a great place to kick off your sporting spirit with your friends and colleagues!

4) Had a wonderful time with office colleagues after long time.
Had fun.
But the ground is short, more height would have been better

5) Well maintained turf with seating area and snacks.
Bats are good at competitive market rates. Music just sets the perfect mood.

6) The turf is located in heart of sector 5 , and the building is very classy üëè.
Playing here gives a heavenly feel . It is at 16th floor and the view from here is fantastic.
The quality of turf is very good and provides best playing experience.

7) Staffs are good. But ground area is not adequate.

8) Wonderful place for a Team Get Together for small cricket or football matches.

9) The most valuable addition to the turf society, with latest technology that provides high quality videos of shoots taken while playing.

10) V nice and accomodative people.
Needs improvement in Lights and Pitch for cricket. That's it.
